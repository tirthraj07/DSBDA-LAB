# Data Science and Big Data Analytics Lab

This repo contains all my assignments during the DSBDA Lab in Sem 6.

| Sr. | Name | Description |
|----|------|-------------|
| 1 | Data Wrangling I | Perform the following operations using Python on any open-source dataset (e.g., data.csv): <br> 1. Import all required Python Libraries. <br> 2. Locate an open-source dataset (e.g., https://www.kaggle.com), provide a clear description and source URL. <br> 3. Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame. <br> 4. Data Preprocessing: Check for missing values using `isnull()`, get initial statistics using `describe()`, provide variable descriptions and types. Check dimensions of the DataFrame. <br> 5. Data Formatting and Normalization: Check and convert data types (character, numeric, integer, factor, logical). <br> 6. Turn categorical variables into quantitative variables. <br> In addition to the codes and outputs, explain every operation clearly. |
| 2 | Data Wrangling II | Create an "Academic performance" dataset of students and: <br> 1. Scan all variables for missing values and inconsistencies, handle appropriately. <br> 2. Scan numeric variables for outliers and handle appropriately. <br> 3. Apply transformations to variables (for better scaling, linearity, or normality). Document your approach properly. |
| 3 | Descriptive Statistics: Measures of Central Tendency and Variability | Perform the following: <br> 1. On `[nba.csv]`: Provide summary statistics (mean, median, min, max, std deviation) grouped by a categorical variable. <br> 2. On `[iris.csv]`: Display basic statistics (percentile, mean, std deviation) for each Iris species (`setosa`, `versicolor`, `virginica`). Provide codes, outputs, and explanations. |
| 4 | Data Visualization I | Using the inbuilt `titanic` dataset (891 rows): <br> 1. Use Seaborn to find patterns. <br> 2. Plot a histogram for 'fare' to see price distribution. |
| 5 | Data Visualization II | Using `titanic` dataset: <br> 1. Plot a box plot for 'age' distribution across 'sex' and survival status. <br> 2. Write observations based on the plots. |
| 6 | Data Visualization III | Using the `iris.csv` dataset: <br> 1. List all features and their types. <br> 2. Create histograms for each feature. <br> 3. Create box plots for each feature. <br> 4. Compare distributions and identify outliers. |
| 7 | Data Analytics I | Create a Linear Regression Model in Python/R to predict home prices using the Boston Housing Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing). Objective: Predict house prices using the features. |
| 8 | Data Analytics II | Problem Statement: <br> 1. Implement Logistic Regression on `Social_Network_Ads.csv`. <br> 2. Compute confusion matrix and derive TP, FP, TN, FN, Accuracy, Error rate, Precision, Recall. |
| 9 | Data Analytics III | Implement a Simple Na√Øve Bayes classifier using Python/R on `iris.csv`. <br> Compute Confusion matrix and derive TP, FP, TN, FN, Accuracy, Error rate, Precision, Recall. |
| 10 | Text Analytics | 1. Extract a sample document and apply: Tokenization, POS Tagging, Stop words removal, Stemming, Lemmatization. <br> 2. Calculate Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency representations. |
| 11 | Hadoop Word Count | Write a Java program for a Word Count application using Hadoop Map-Reduce framework in a local-standalone setup. |
| 13 | Apache Spark Word Count | Write a simple program in Scala using the Apache Spark Framework for Word Count. |
